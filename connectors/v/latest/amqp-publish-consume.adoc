= To Listen For A Reply

Request/Reply is a very common pattern between applications, thus the new AMQP Connector provides an operation specially designed for that, called `publish-consume`. The `publish-consume` operation allows you to publish a Message to any destination, and then wait for a reply on a different Destination.

When using this operation, the replyTo property of the outgoing Message will contain the id of the Destination on which our applicatrion will be waiting for a response. This destination may be a well-known destination, or it may be a temporary queue created on the fly with the only purpose of receiving a single response message.

Finally, the result of the operation will be the Message received as a response, with exactly the same structure as if a `consume` operation was invoked.

== Waiting For A Reply On A Temporary Queue

Using a temporary Queue to wait for a response is very simple, just configure the message being sent and the operation will automatically wait for a response in a temporary Queue:
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<amqp:publish-consume config-ref="config" exchangeName="targetExchange" maximumWait="20" maximumWaitUnit="SECONDS"/>
----

In this example, the operation will `publish` a Message with the current `payload` as its *body* and the *replyTo property* of the message configured to a temporary destination, to the `targetExchange`.
Then, it will automatically try to consume the response from that temporary Queue until a Message is consumed or the `maximumWait` is reached (in which case it will fail with a `AMQP:TIMEOUT` error).

== Receiving The Reply On A Known Queue

In many cases you don't want reply queues to be created per-request basis, but instead a well-known Queue is used for replies. For this cases, all you have to do is to configure the `reply-to` parameter on the outgoing Message:
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<amqp:publish-consume config-ref="config" exchangeName="targetExchange">
    <amqp:message>
    		<amqp:properties reply-to="replyToQueue" />
    </amqp:message>
</amqp:publish-consume>
----

Now the operation will `publish` a Message to the `targetExchange` with the current `payload` as its *body* and the `replyTo` *property* configured with the `replyToQueue`.
Then, it will automatically try to consume the response from the `replyToQueue` Queue until a Message is consumed or the `maximumWait` is reached (in which case it will fail with a `AMQP:TIMEOUT` error).
